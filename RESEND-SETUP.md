# ðŸ“§ Simplified Email Configuration with Resend

## âœ… What Changed

We've simplified the email setup to use **Resend for everything**:
- âœ… NextAuth magic link emails â†’ Resend API
- âœ… Contact form relay â†’ Resend API  
- âœ… Business notifications â†’ Resend API

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Update

### Required (Keep These):
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY="your_resend_api_key_here"
EMAIL_FROM="noreply@directorvalue.com"
```

## ðŸš€ Production Setup (Vercel)

In your Vercel environment variables, you only need:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@directorvalue.com
```

## âœ¨ Benefits

1. **Simpler Setup**: One API key for all emails
2. **Better Emails**: Custom-designed sign-in emails with Director Value branding
3. **Unified System**: All emails go through Resend's reliable delivery
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single email service to manage

## ðŸŽ¯ Test the New Setup

1. **Local Testing**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
   # Enter th.mentis@mtxstudio.com
   # Check email for styled magic link
   ```

2. **Production Testing** (after Vercel deploy):
   ```bash
   # Visit https://directorvalue.com/auth/signin
   # Enter admin email and check for magic link
   ```

## ðŸ“§ New Email Design

The magic link emails now include:
- âœ… Director Value branding
- âœ… Professional styling
- âœ… Clear call-to-action button
- âœ… Security messaging (24-hour expiry)
- âœ… Both HTML and plain text versions

Much cleaner and more professional than generic SMTP emails!
